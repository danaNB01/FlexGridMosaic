# FlexGridMosaic
I learned SO much building this project regarding flexbox, CSS grid, and how they work together to create a responsive and interactive design—using a little bit of JavaScript ;) Thanks to Zach Gollwitzer's tutorial, a great teacher and developer. This is just the beginning, with much more to come! ✨
